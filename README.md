# MIPS-Computer
Open the .circ file in Logisim-Evolution, compile a .asm file in a terminal with: ./assemble.exe kernel.asm 'input_file.asm' static_output.bin inst_output.bin
Then put the instruction output in ROM & the static output in RAM. To see the Starry Night painting, use both new_decimal.asm draw_static.asm
This project was made in collaboration with Henry Groves.
